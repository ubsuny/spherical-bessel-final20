\begin{abstract}
    The following is the write up for my computational physics final on the topic of \emph{Eigenfrequencies of a Spherical Electromagnetic Cavity}. This pdf writeup stands in for the wiki which comes with github as it is unable to render latex. An explanation for how this file was compiled can be found both in the readme and the wiki of the repository and the latex source files can also be found in the repository.
