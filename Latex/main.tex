\section{Conclusion}
We began by looking at the conditions for a Spherical Electromagnetic Cavity. We were able to successfully use separation of variables to solve the Helmholtz equation is spherical coordinates in order to find the Eigenfunctions for this specific geometry. This allowed us to relate the zeros of Spherical Bessel functions, as well as the size of the cavity to the Eigenfrequencies of these resonant cavities. We then looked at the various analytic ways to compute these Bessel functions and some computational methods implemented by others. Finally we were able to devise a strategy more efficiently find the zeros of higher Eigenfrequencies using the trig functions that make up the Spherical Bessel Functions.
